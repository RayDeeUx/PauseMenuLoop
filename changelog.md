# PauseMenuLoop Changelog
## v1.4.0
- Experimental iOS JIT-less support.
- Refactored how song randomization works--it happens every time you enter a level now, instead of every time you pause. This was to minimize lag when pausing a level.
- Fixed a few nasty bugs that led to the pause menu loop playing outside of the pause menu. Yikes!
## v1.3.2
- Experimental iOS support.
## v1.3.1
- Fix being unable to use the `Pause Menu Loop` setting. \*groans in regret\*
## v1.3.0
- Port to 2.2074.
## v1.2.0
- Added `Muffle Filter` options based on code adapted from Undefined's EditorMusic mod with permission.
- Allowed settings to be applied to the pause menu loop in real time.
- Added support for `.flac` and `.oga` files. 
## v1.1.0
